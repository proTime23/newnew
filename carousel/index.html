          <p>Naruto Uzumaki (Japanese う ず ま き ナ ル ル and in English Naruto Uzumaki) is the main character of the series
            "Naruto". The name Naruto can mean "vortex", which is also the name of a cut stick with a pink vortex in its
            middle that is used to put on ramen, which is also the food that Naruto loves. Uzumaki "is a
            three-dimensional spiral, like a vortex. A more accurate meaning would be" Rasen ", which is also part of
            the name of Naruto's attack, the" Rasengan ", also the leaf symbol of a leaf village painted with an arrow
            attached to a spiral, also part of the seal on his stomach is A spiral, and also the symbol on his jacket
            and shoulders is a spiral. Another meaning of the name "Uzumaki" is "storm", which is probably named after
            the vortex "Naruto" (which actually happened in the city of Naruto). Another interesting fact, is that his
            mother, Kushina Uzumaki, is from the land of the whirlpool.

          <h2>Dragon-Ball</h2>
          <p>Dragon Ball (Japanese: ド ラ ゴ ン ボ ー ー ル, Hebrew: Dragon Ball) is a popular Japanese anime and manga series
            created by Akira Toriyama inspired by the popular Chinese novel "Journey to the West". The television series
            aired in Japan from 1986-1989.

            The manga series was published in "Weekly Shōnen Jump" (Ramadi Edition) in the years 1984-1995. 519 episodes
            of the series were bound in 42 volumes. The success of the series led to the production of four animated
            series in the Dragon Ball franchise of Tui Animation Studios, as well as the creation of special TV shows,
            video games, anime films (most of which were dubbed into Hebrew "Dragon Ball" and "Dragon Ball Z"), and even
            a live-movie American Action (2009) called "Dragon Ball: Evolution". The series has been appreciated by
            manga artists, and some have noted that it has inspired them to develop successful manga series, such as
            Masashi Kishimoto's Naruto and Aichiro Ode's One Piece.

            In Israel, unlike the other series in the franchise, the original series was not broadcast on television.

          </h2>
          <p class="lead">'1) Lucky Row knows how to draw.

            2) Yasup is able to hit a fly between the eyes from a distance of miles.

            3) The average giant lives to the age of 350.

            4) The average dwarf lives up to the age of 150.

            5) The mermaid's tail splits at age 30.

            6) The All Blue contains fish species from all four days.

            7) 2 characters so far have shown ability to deflect bullets / bullets with their blades, and they are
            Tashigi and Casting.

            8) Tashigi's dream is to collect all the Maito, when Zoro asked her if she wanted his sword she said she did
            not necessarily want them for herself but would just be in safe hands.

            9) Zoro's Yubashiri was the best-selling merchandise seller in Logtown.

            10) Zoro's Kitatsu is heavier than an average sword and is also capable of cutting by itself, in addition
            Zoro is able to feel its presence.

            11) All the cactus hills in Whiskey Pick are covered in tombs.

            12) Zoro eliminated / defeated 99 out of 100 Baroque Works agents at Whiskey Pick.

            13) Zoro and Nami are able to drink a lot without getting drunk, of course there is a limit but it is
            insane, in their son whiskey pick competition Nami defeated Zoro, Zoro fell after 13 people and reached the
            edge, while Nami held against 15 people and could go on for a lot more. As a fencer Zoro can not afford to
            fall for alcohol, and Nami can continue to drink much more than she presented, especially on an interesting
            island like Whiskey Pick.
            So if you ever see one of them getting drunk in the future you will know that this is probably a show or
            they just broke their drinking limit.

            14) Zoro cut a cannonball at Baratti with his eyes closed.

            15) Chopper is able to communicate with animals, and in addition his senses are very developed.

            16) Top 9 Pearl Pearl Bullets with his wooden leg.

          <p class="lead">During Dragon Ball, Dragon Ball Z and Dragon Ball GT, Goku carried out the Kama Maha attack 97
            times.

            The actor who dubbed Goku in the English version, fainted during Goku's dubbing becomes Super Saiya 4 in the
            Dragon Ball GT.

            Burma had 17 hairstyles in the series
            The creator of the series, Akira Toriyama, said his favorite character is Piccolo.

            Goku's mother is called Gina

            The battle between Goku and Paris lasted 3 and a half hours of screen time! (Of which probably 3 hours of
            Goku shouting "Ahahahaha")

            Hitler's character appeared in the movie Dragon Ball Z: Fusion Reborn
            Biogi Ho has a card called "Tyler the Great Warrior" and is based on the character of Trunks.

            Guten was supposed to replace Goku as the main character but there was a fear of anger from the fans.

            Napa once had hair
            Apart from Trunks, Burma and Makita also had a girl called 'Bra'.

            Director James Wang claimed he had never seen any episode of the series and had not read the manga before
            creating the movie 'Dragon Ball: Evolution' in 2009. (Now understand why this is a bad movie)

            There are no nameky females, namak are born from an egg that comes out of the mouth. (What the hell?!)</p>
